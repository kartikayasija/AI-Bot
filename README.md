## What I learned through this project

- Calling APIs: Throughout this project, I gained practical experience in calling APIs. I learned how to make requests to external services or internal endpoints, handle different types of requests such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, and process the responses returned by the APIs.

- Passport.js: I learned about Passport.js, a popular authentication middleware for Node.js. I gained knowledge on how to use Passport.js to implement authentication strategies such as local, GoogleAuth . I learned to configure and customize Passport.js, handle authentication flows, and secure routes based on user authentication.
